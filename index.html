                            <p>Assignment 4 involves recreating a specific University of South Carolina webpage. The task requires employing HTML5 elements (header, footer, nav, section, aside, article) in a traditional header/content/footer structure, coupled with CSS Flexbox for styling. The webpage must feature a responsive navigation bar that remains visible on small screens, use placeholder images, and have all text replaced with Lorem Ipsum. Additionally, all hyperlinks should redirect to '#', and the color scheme must match the original page using a color picker tool. The assignment is designed to enhance the ability to accurately replicate HTML/CSS layouts, with particular emphasis on flexbox utilization for responsive design.</p>

First, implement a rotating advertisement banner that cycles through an array of at least five texts every 2 seconds, looping back to the first after displaying the last. Ensure the initial text is visible on page load. Second, display a series of images with attributions by looping through an associative array, presenting each image with its corresponding attribution and a hyperlink to the source. </p>
